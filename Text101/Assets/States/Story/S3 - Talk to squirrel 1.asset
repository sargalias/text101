  storyText: "Squirrel tells you to be careful because there is a large tiger called
    \"Kitty\" who is very dangerous and hunts turtles who come looking for watermelon.
    Watch out for her if you see her.\r\n\r\n\"If you're unlucky enough that she spots
    you, head to the crossroads and go left\". The squirrel then points towards the
    distance and says \"P.S. the watermelon is that way\".\r\n\r\nThe squirrel then
    jumps away to go get nuts from a nearby tree.\r\n\r\n1: Keep going towards the
    watermelon."
