  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  storyText: "Kitty is close now and is getting even closer. You don't have a lot
    of time until she's here. You don't have a stone to throw at her either.\r\n\r\nYou
    look at Squirrel and you see he's carrying around 10 nuts or so. Each one is roughly
    the size of a stone...\r\n\r\n1: Quick! Ask squirrel for a nut.\r\n\r\n2: Spend
    some time thinking about why squirrels eat nuts, watermelon is so much better.\r\n\r\n3:
    Tell squirrel to throw a nut at Kitty."
