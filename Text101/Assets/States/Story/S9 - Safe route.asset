  storyText: "You change route and go through some bushes, progressing even slower.
    Next over some rocks which you find quite difficult.\r\n\r\nThere is a small drop
    on the next rock and a gust of wind makes you slip, causing you to lose balance.
    You roll down with spectacular tumbles and hit the bottom.\r\n\r\nThankfully you
    have shell, so you're fine. It was quite loud though and you're worried the tiger
    may have heard you.\r\n\r\n1: Stay put for a while and hide, just in case.\r\n\r\n2:
    Keep going, watermelon calls!\r\n\r\n"
