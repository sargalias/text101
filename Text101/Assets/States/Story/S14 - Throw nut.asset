  m_Name: S14 - Throw nut
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  storyText: "The squirrel looks hesitant. He looks at the nut, then he looks at you,
    then he looks at the nut again. He makes a sad face but gives you the nut.\r\n\r\nYou
    throw the nut with your stone throwing powers, hitting Kitty right on the head.
    Kitty knows she is dealing with a powerful opponent, so turns and walks away (or
    more likely she saw something more interesting in that direction).\r\n\r\nThe
    watermelon is right in front of you.\r\n\r\n1: Claim the watermelon treasure!"
