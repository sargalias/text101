  storyText: "You've been walking for a few minutes, but being a turtle you haven't
    covered much ground. However you're certain the watermelon is not too far now.\r\n\r\nAs
    you keep walking you notice what looks like a large tiger in the distance. You
    think that her name is probably \"Kitty\".\r\n\r\n1: Keep going in the direction
    of the watermelon.\r\n\r\n2: Take a longer but safer route to avoid Kitty."
