  storyText: "You pick up some stones and get ready to throw them at Kitty. You charge
    up and throw towards her at full force.\r\n\r\nAs the stone is travelling through
    mid-air, Kitty stops and turns her head to the right. Your stone lands somewhere
    about 5 feet short of her, but she doesn't notice.\r\n\r\nHer ears pop up as though
    she hears something, and she starts heading toward that direction.\r\n\r\nYou're
    safe for now.\r\n\r\n1: Continue the hunt for the watermelon."
