  storyText: "You look behind you and there's still some distance between you and
    Kitty, she hasn't caught up to you yet.\r\n\r\nIn front of you there are 3 paths.\r\n\r\nThe
    one to the left leads between some trees that are closely packed together, where
    Kitty would have trouble traversing through. You think you should be able to fit
    through there.\r\n\r\nThe one to the right is a dead end.\r\n\r\nThe one straight
    ahead is an open path.\r\n\r\nThere are also some small stones nearby you can
    use for throwing.\r\n\r\n1: Go left.\r\n\r\n2: Go right.\r\n\r\n3: Go forward.\r\n\r\n4:
    Pick up stones and throw them at Kitty."
