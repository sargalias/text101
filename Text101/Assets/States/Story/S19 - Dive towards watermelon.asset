  storyText: "You run faster than you've ever run before (still quite slowly, all
    things considered). You're now very close to the watermelon, but Kitty is catching
    up very quickly too.\r\n\r\nPutting everything you have into it, you jump as far
    as you can and dive straight in the middle of all the watermelons!\r\n\r\nYou
    see Kitty stopping, obviously she doesn't like watermelon very much. She turns
    and slowly walks away.\r\n\r\n1: Continue."
