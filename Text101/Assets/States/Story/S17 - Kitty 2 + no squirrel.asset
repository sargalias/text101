  storyText: "You tell Squirrel to go away and he leaves.\r\n\nYou walk for a few
    more minutes.\r\n\r\nUp ahead you start to notice a round dark green object. As
    you look closer, you notice that there are more of them, quite a lot actually.\r\n\r\nYou
    become very excited and realise that you've found the watermelon! Not just 1 or
    2 watermelons, but lots and lots of them!\r\n\r\nYou can't contain your excitement
    and you start running (still going at slow pace though) towards the treasure of
    watermelons.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, right behind the treasure, is Kitty. She has
    spotted you and is heading towards you.\r\n\r\n1: Continue.\r"
