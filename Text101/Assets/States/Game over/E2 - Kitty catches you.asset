  m_Name: E2 - Kitty catches you
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  storyText: "Kitty is now rushing towards you at full speed.\r\n\r\nAs she's getting
    close she raises her paw high up, ready for a swing. With perfect timing she swings
    at you with full force.\r\n\r\nThankfully you have shell and you have withdrawn
    fully into it for protection, however the swing knocks you high up in the air
    and away. As you're flying away, you see Squirrel waving goodbye to you while
    eating his nut, then running up a tree.\r\n\r\nEventually you fall back down.
    You got knocked so far back that you're now at the beach where you started.\r\n\r\nGuess
    watermelon was not meant to be.\r\n\r\n1: Play again."
